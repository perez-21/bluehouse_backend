    "# Must Know\n",
    "For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concepts Needed:\n",
    "- Lists and List Manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.\n",
    "  Python Lists [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)\n",
    "- Graph Theory Basics:\n",
    "  Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.\n",
    "  Graph Theory [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)\n",
    "- Algorithmic Complexity:\n",
    "  Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.\n",
    "  Big O Notation [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)\n",
    "- Recursion:\n",
    "  Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.\n",
    "  Recursion in Python [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)\n",
    "- Queue and Stack:\n",
    "  Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.\n",
    "  Python Queue and Stack [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)\n",
    "- Set Operations:\n",
    "  Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.\n",
    "  Python Sets (Python Official Documentation) https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets\n",
    "\n",
    "By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.\n",
